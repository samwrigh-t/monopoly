- **SELLING PROPERTY:** All housing / hotels must be sold before selling a property to another player.

- **BUILDING SHORTAGES:** When the Bank has no houses to sell, players
  wishing to build must wait for some player to return or sell histher
  houses to the Bank before building. If there are a limited number of
  houses and hotels available and two or more players wish to buy more
  than the Bank has, the houses or hotels must be sold at auction to the
  highest bidder.

- **MORTGAGES:** Unimproved properties can be mortgaged through the
  Bank at any time. Before an improved property can be mortgaged, all
  the buildings on all the properties of its color-group must be sold back
  to the Bank at half price. The mortgage value is printed on each Title
  Deed card.

- No rent can be collected on mortgaged properties or utilities,
  but rent can be collected on unmortgaged properties in the
  same group.

- In order to lift the mortgage, the owner must pay the Bank the
  amount of the mortgage plus 10% interest. When all the propert~es of
  a color-group are no longer mortgaged, the owner may begin to buy
  back houses at full price.
  The player who mortgages property retains possession of it and
  no other player may secure it by lifting the mortgage from the Bank.
  However, the owner may sell this mortgaged property to another player
  at any agreed price. If you are the new owner, you may lift the mortgage
  at once if you wish by paying off the mortgage plus
  10% interest to the Bank. If the mortgage is not lifted
  at once, you must pay the Bank 10% interest when
  you buy the property and if you lift the
  mortgage later you must pay the Bank
  an additional 10% interest as well
  as the amount of the mortgage.

- **BANKRUPTCY..** You are declared bankrupt if you owe more than you
  can pay either to another player or to the Bank. If your debt is to another player, you must turn over to that player all that you have of value and retire from the game. In making this settlement, if you own houses or hotels, you must return these to the Bank in exchange for money to the extent of one-half the amount paid for them; this cash is given to the creditor. If you have mortgaged property you also turn this property over to your creditor but the new owner must at once pay. The Bank the amount of interest on the loan, which is 10% of the value of the property The new owner who does this may then, at hislher option, pay the principal or hold the property until some later turn, then lift the mortgage. If they hold property in this way until a later turn, they must pay the interest again upon lifting the mortgage. Should you owe the Bank, instead of another player, more than you can pay (because of taxes or penalties) even by selling off buildings and mortgaging property, you must turn over all assets to the Bank. In this case, the Bank immediately sells by auction all property so taken, except buildings. A bankrupt player must immediately retire from the game. The last player left in the game wins.

- **MISC:** Money can be loaned to a player only by the Bank
  and then only by mortgaging property. No player may borrow from or
  lend money to another player
